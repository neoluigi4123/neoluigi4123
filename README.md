# Hii there! I'm Neo (✿◕‿◕)

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a developer who loves bridging the gap between **complex AI architecture** and **chaotic, fun user experiences**.

I spend most of my time teaching LLMs how to act human, automating my Linux environment, and breaking things until they work beautifully.

### 🧠 The "Serious" Stuff
I don't just prompt AI; I build ecosystems for them to live in. My main focus is **Agentic AI & Discord integration**.
*   **AI Orchestration:** Experience building Multi-Party Chat Assistants (MPCA) that handle group contexts, decision-making, and "Chain of Thought" reasoning.
*   **Full-Stack AI:** Integrating Vision, TTS, Image Generation, and RAG (Long-term memory) into cohesive personalities.
*   **System Control:** I love the terminal. If it can be done with a GUI, I’ll probably write a CLI tool for it instead.

### 🎨 The Creative Side
When I'm not staring at logs, I'm usually creating.
*   **Game Dev:** Tinkering with physics and mechanics in Unity & Godot.
*   **Digital Art:** 3D Modeling (Blender) and Graphic Design (Adobe Suite).
*   **Languages:** Fluent in 🇫🇷 & 🇬🇧, learning 🇮🇹 & 🇯🇵.

### 🔭 Current Focus
*   **Advanced Discord Bots:** Developing a "Neuro-sama" style entity with distinct persona, autonomy, and tool-use capabilities (Web browsing, code execution).
*   **Linux Automation:** Building custom CLI assistants to handle local files, system monitoring, and media playback directly in the terminal.
*   **Dataset Curation:** refining data to fine-tune models for specific roleplay and assistance tasks.

### 📬 Let's Connect!
I'm always down to talk about neural networks, game logic, or just exchange music recommendations! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
